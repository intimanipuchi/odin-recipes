    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is the recipe of a sourdough rye bread. It can be a bit difficult to work with rye flour, especially at the beginning. But in my opinion it is a rewarding learning process. I used my rye sourdough starter, which was gradually produced from wheat starter. This recipe requires some patience, but not much effort, really.

      The most important part is of course the starter. The recipe is much less likely to fail if you have a vigorous and fresh starter to work with. One tip I learned recently about the rye starter is that it works better at higher hydration compared to its wheat cousin. If I use 100% hydration for wheat, rye starter seems to thrive at approximately 125-150%, although I don't bother too much with exact measurement. Rather, I shoot for a certain consistency, and and kind of measure by feel.

    <p>The following recipe is based on the <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/rye-sourdough-bread">BBC recipe</a> of the sourdough rye bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Starter: 100g</li>
      <li>Flour: 500g</li>
      <li>Water: 400g</li>
      <li>Dry milk: ~10g</li>
      <li>Melted butter: 40g</li>
      <li>Salt: 10g</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Measure the flour in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Measure the water, add dry milk to it. Mix and pour into the flour.</li>
      <li>Measure the starter (doesn't have to be too precise), and add to the bowl.</li>
      <li>Microwave the butter until melted. Start whisking the flour and water, and pour butter in the mixture</li>
      <li>Mix well until combined. Leave for about 2 hours, then incorporate salt into the dough.</li>
      <li>Let rise for a few hours or overnight. When the dough is sufficinely risen (about 1.5 times its original size is ok for rye; it should feel puffy on touch), transfer on floured surface and shape into whaterver shape you're going to bake it. Then transfer to the baking pan.</li>
      <li>Bake at 230 C for about 50 min until done. Transfer to a grid to cool down.</li>
    </ol>
