    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is the recipe of a sourdough rye bread. It can be a bit difficult to work with rye flour, especially at the beginning. But in my opinion it is a rewarding learning process. I used my rye sourdough starter, which was gradually produced from wheat starter. This recipe requires some patience, but not much effort, really.

      The most important part is of course the starter. The recipe is much less likely to fail if you have a vigorous and fresh starter to work with. One tip I learned recently about the rye starter is that it works better at higher hydration compared to its wheat cousin. If I use 100% hydration for wheat, rye starter seems to thrive at approximately 125-150%, although I don't bother too much with exact measurement. Rather, I shoot for a certain consistency, and and kind of measure by feel.
